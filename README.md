###Rules
1. Press START button; SIMON will illuminate the first colored section in a sequence.

2. Begin by pressing the same section.

3. SIMON will duplicate the first move and add one.

4. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same sections.

5. SIMON will duplicate these signals and continue to add one.

6. Continue in this manner as long as you can repeat the sequence correctly.

7. After the 4th, 8th and 12th signals in a sequence, SIMON will automatically increase the tempo.

8. If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly or if you take more than 5 seconds to repeat a signal, SIMON responds with a
"RAZZ" sound indicating that you have lost.
